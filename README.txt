# Wilderness_Escape

Wilderness Escape is a choose-your-own-adventure game built using Python.
Using the trees data structure, I created a story where a user can choose
the outcome (similiar to a Goosebumps book). 
It's a simple way to grasp nodes, linked lists, and parent/child relationships
within CS. 

This project is an assignment from Codecademy.
